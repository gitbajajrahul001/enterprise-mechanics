# Security Architecture – Case Study (ACME Corp)

This section extends the ACME Corp transformation journey, focusing on how security architecture evolved across Strategy, Plan, Ready, and Adopt phases.

During earlier phases, ACME Corp had defined:

- Compliance-driven controls (SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR)  
- Strong emphasis on segmentation and access control  
- Initial intent to adopt Zero Trust principles  

However, these decisions were still conceptual and had not yet been validated against real application and operational constraints.

---

## 🔷 1. Initial Understanding

---

At the start of the Ready phase, the security vision was *Implement Zero Trust with strict IAM, network isolation, and full compliance enforcement*

### **Observations**

- Strong focus on compliance and control  
- Assumption that identity-based access could be enforced everywhere  
- Limited consideration for legacy systems and operational readiness  

>
> The initial design optimized for control and compliance, not for operational feasibility.
>

---

## 🔷 2. What We Discovered

---

As workloads began onboarding, several realities emerged:

### **IAM Fragmentation**

- Multiple identity systems across applications  
- Inconsistent role definitions  
- Lack of centralized governance  

### **Examples:**

- Different teams managing access independently  
- Users accumulating excessive permissions  

### **Legacy System Constraints**

- Older systems unable to support modern authentication mechanisms  
- Reliance on network-based trust  

### **Examples:**

- Core banking system accessible based on network location rather than identity  

### **Secrets Management Issues**

- Credentials stored in application configs  
- Limited use of centralized vaults  

### **Examples:**

- Database passwords embedded in deployment scripts  

### **Compliance vs Practical Security**

- Controls implemented for audits, not real risk reduction  

### **Examples:**

- Logging enabled but not actively monitored  
- Encryption enabled without proper key lifecycle management  

### **Operational Gaps**

- Security alerts not actionable  
- Lack of incident response maturity  

### **Examples:**

- Suspicious login activity not escalated due to alert fatigue

## 🔷 3. Decisions Made

---

### **Decision 1: Adopt Hybrid Security Model**

Instead of full Zero Trust:

- Identity-first for modern applications  
- Network-based controls retained for legacy systems  


### **Examples:**

- New applications using RBAC and MFA  
- Legacy systems restricted via network segmentation  

### **Decision 2: Standardize IAM Model**

- Defined centralized role structures  
- Introduced role governance and review processes  

### **Examples:**

- Role-based access aligned with job functions  
- Periodic access reviews enforced  

### **Decision 3: Centralize Secrets Management**

- Introduced centralized secrets vault  
- Eliminated hard-coded credentials  

### **Examples:**

- Applications retrieving secrets dynamically  
- Automated credential rotation  

### **Decision 4: Align Security with Risk, Not Just Compliance**

- Mapped controls to actual risks  
- Reduced redundant or ineffective controls  

### **Examples:**

- Focused monitoring on high-risk systems  
- Simplified low-risk environments  

### **Decision 5: Integrate Security into Platform**

- Embedded security controls into platform layer  
- Reduced manual intervention  

### **Examples:**

- Managed identities used by default  
- Policies enforcing encryption and access controls  

### **Decision 6: Improve Security Observability**

- Centralized logging and monitoring  
- Correlated identity, network, and application events  

### **Examples:**

- Detecting unauthorized access patterns across systems  
- Improved incident response capability

## 🔷 4. What Changed During Execution

---


| Initial Assumption | Reality |
|------------------|--------|
| Zero Trust can be implemented uniformly | Requires phased adoption |
| IAM will remain simple | Becomes complex without governance |
| Compliance ensures security | Requires risk-based prioritization |
| Secrets can be managed easily | Needs strong centralized control |
| Security tools provide visibility | Requires integration and correlation |

>
> Security evolved from a compliance-driven model to a **risk-aware, integrated architecture**
>

## 🔷 5. Final Security Architecture State

---

At the end of initial transformation phases, ACME Corp had:

- Hybrid security model combining identity and network controls  
- Centralized IAM with governance processes  
- Integrated secrets management  
- Risk-aligned security controls  
- Improved visibility and monitoring  

### **Resulting Security Model:**

```text

        ↓
Identity Layer (IAM, MFA, RBAC)

## 🔍 Closing Thoughts

---

ACME Corp’s journey highlights that:

- Zero Trust must be adopted incrementally  
- IAM requires continuous governance  
- Compliance is only a baseline  
- Security must be integrated into platform and operations

> The most effective security architectures are not the most restrictive — they are the most integrated and adaptable.
