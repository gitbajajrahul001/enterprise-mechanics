# Application Architecture – Case Study (ACME Corp)

This section extends the ACME Corp transformation journey, focusing specifically on how application architecture decisions evolved during the engagement.

---

## 🧭 Context

During the initial phases (Strategy → Plan → Ready), ACME Corp identified:

- A fragmented application landscape  
- Heavy reliance on legacy monolithic systems  
- Increasing demand for scalable digital applications  

However, architectural decisions were still largely assumption-driven.

---

## 🔷 1. Initial Understanding

At the start of the engagement, the client’s architectural vision was:

> “Move to microservices and cloud-native architecture”

---

### Observations

- Microservices seen as a default target  
- No clear understanding of system boundaries  
- Limited visibility into dependencies  

---

### 🧠 Insight

> The goal was defined as an architecture pattern, not as a business outcome.

---

## 🔷 2. What We Discovered

As application-level analysis progressed, several realities emerged:

---

### **Monolithic Core Systems**

- Core banking application tightly coupled  
- Shared database across multiple functions  
- No clear separation of modules  

---

### **Hidden Coupling**

- Reporting systems directly accessing production databases  
- Multiple services depending on the same authentication layer  
- Batch jobs embedded within core systems  

---

### **Inconsistent Architecture Across Applications**

- Some applications were partially modular  
- Others were tightly coupled monoliths  
- Few had any form of service separation  

---

### **Operational Limitations**

- No centralized monitoring for distributed systems  
- Limited experience with API management  
- No event-driven infrastructure  

---

### 🧠 Key Insight

> The architecture was not monolithic or microservices — it was a mix of both, with hidden dependencies.

---

## 🔷 3. Decisions Made

---

### **Decision 1: Avoid Full Microservices Transformation**

Instead of:

- Breaking entire system into microservices  

Approach taken:

- Retain core monolith  
- Introduce API layer for external access  
- Extract only high-value services  

---

### **Decision 2: Introduce API-First Layer**

- APIs created to expose core functionality  
- Decoupled frontend applications from backend systems  

---

### Example:

- Mobile banking app now interacts via APIs  
- Core system remains unchanged initially  

---

### **Decision 3: Selective Service Extraction**

Services identified for extraction:

- Payment processing  
- Notification service  
- Customer profile management  

---

### Why These?

- High scalability requirements  
- Clear boundaries  
- Lower coupling compared to core system  

---

### **Decision 4: Controlled Use of Event-Driven Architecture**

Instead of full adoption:

- Introduced event-driven patterns only where needed  

---

### Example:

- Payment completion triggers notification events  
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical workflows  

---

### **Decision 5: Gradual Data Decoupling**

Instead of:

- Immediate database separation  

Approach:

- Introduce APIs over direct DB access  
- Reduce shared database dependencies over time  

---

### ⚠️ Key Challenge

- Reporting systems still required direct access initially  
- Full decoupling deferred to later phases  

---

## 🔷 4. What Changed During Execution

| Initial Assumption | Reality |
|------------------|--------|
| Microservices is the target architecture | Hybrid architecture is required |
| Systems can be cleanly separated | Hidden dependencies exist |
| Data can be easily decoupled | Data coupling is a major constraint |
| Event-driven architecture can be widely applied | Limited to specific use cases |

---

### 🧠 Key Insight

> Architecture evolved from an ideal target to a **pragmatic hybrid model**

---

## 🔷 5. Final Architecture State

At the end of initial transformation phases, ACME Corp had:

- Core monolithic system retained  
- API layer introduced for access  
- Select services extracted as independent components  
- Limited event-driven patterns implemented  
- Gradual reduction of data coupling  

---

### Resulting Architecture:

```text
Frontend Apps
     ↓
API Layer
     ↓
--------------------------
| Core Monolith          |
| (Banking System)       |
--------------------------
     ↓
--------------------------
| Extracted Services     |
| (Payments, Notifications) |
--------------------------
     ↓
Event Layer (Selective)
```

## 🔗 Impact on Other Domains

These architectural decisions directly influenced:

- **Platform Engineering**  
  *(e.g., need for API gateways, CI/CD pipelines)*  

- **Network Architecture**  
  *(e.g., service-to-service communication patterns)*  

- **Security**  
  *(e.g., API authentication, identity management)*  

- **Observability**  
  *(e.g., tracing across services)*  

---

### 🧠 Key Insight

Application architecture is not transformed in one step — it is **incrementally evolved while maintaining system stability**

---

## 🔍 Closing Thoughts

ACME Corp’s journey highlights that:

- Ideal architecture is rarely achievable immediately  
- Transformation must be incremental  
- Decisions must balance risk, complexity, and business needs  

---

> The most successful architectures are not the most modern — they are the most adaptable.
