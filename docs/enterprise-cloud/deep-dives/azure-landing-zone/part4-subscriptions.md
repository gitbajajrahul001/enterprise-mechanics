# 💳 Designing Subscription Strategy

### _Where Ownership, Cost, and Control Actually Live_

If Management Groups define *governance*…

> Subscriptions define accountability

* * *

## 🔥 Why Subscription Design is Critical

Most real problems in cloud don’t come from:

*   networking
*   compute
*   storage

They come from:

*   unclear ownership
*   cost visibility issues
*   access chaos
*   deployment conflicts

👉 All of this ties back to *subscription design*

* * *

## ❌ Common Mistakes

### 1\. One Subscription for Everything

Subscription-1  
├── All apps  
├── All environments  
├── All teams

👉 Result:

*   no cost clarity
*   no isolation
*   access conflicts
*   blast radius is huge

* * *

### 2\. One Subscription per App (blindly)


App1-Sub  
App2-Sub  
App3-Sub

👉 Sounds clean… but:

*   too many subscriptions
*   operational overhead
*   difficult governance
*   duplicated configs

* * *

### 3\. Environment-based only

Prod-Sub  
Dev-Sub  
QA-Sub

👉 Problem:

*   multiple apps mixed
*   ownership unclear
*   cost allocation messy

* * *

## ✅ What Subscriptions Should Represent

A subscription is a boundary for:

*   Ownership
*   Cost (billing unit)
*   Access control
*   Lifecycle management
*   Quotas and limits

* * *

# 🧠 Key Design Dimensions

You must balance these:

## 1\. Ownership


*   Who owns the workload?
*   Which team is accountable?


## 2\. Cost Visibility

*   Can you track cost per:
    *   app?
    *   business unit?
    *   environment?


## 3\. Isolation


*   Blast radius
*   Security boundaries
*   Compliance needs

## 4\. Scale


*   10 apps vs 1000 apps
*   future growth

## 5\. Operations


*   CI/CD pipelines
*   access management
*   monitoring

* * *

# 🏦 Recommended Enterprise Pattern

## Platform Subscriptions

- Platform-Identity  
- Platform-Connectivity  
- Platform-Management

👉 Owned by central cloud/platform team

* * *

## Landing Zone Subscriptions (Workloads)

Instead of 1 rigid rule, use *pattern-based approach*

### **Pattern 1 — App + Environment (most common)**

App1-Prod  
App1-NonProd  
App2-Prod  
App2-NonProd

👉 Good for:

*   clear ownership
*   cost tracking
*   isolation

* * *

### **Pattern 2 — Shared Non-Prod**

App1-Prod  
Shared-NonProd

👉 Useful when:

*   many small apps
*   cost sensitivity
*   early stage

* * *

### **Pattern 3 — Regulated Workloads**

PCI-App1-Prod  
PCI-App1-NonProd

👉 Required when:

*   strict compliance
*   audit isolation
*   policy enforcement

* * *

### **Sandbox Subscription**

Sandbox-Sub

👉 Purpose:

*   experimentation
*   controlled freedom
*   strict budgets

* * *

## ⚖️ Key Trade-offs

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Few subscriptions | Easy management | Poor isolation |
| Many subscriptions | Strong isolation | Operational overhead |

* * *

## 💡 Golden Rule

Design subscriptions around ownership and cost — not just structure

* * *

## 🔁 Relationship with Management Groups

| Level | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| MG | Governance / Policy |
| Subscription | Ownership / Cost / Access |

* * *

## 🧠 Architect Thinking

You don’t ask:

> “How many subscriptions should I create?”

You ask:

> *“Where do I need separate ownership, cost visibility, and isolation?”*

* * *

## 🚨 Subtle but Important Insight

Most failures happen when:

*   MG design is good ✔
*   Subscription design is weak ❌

👉 Result:

*   governance exists
*   but accountability is broken

* * *

# What Comes Next

Now we have:

*   MG structure ✔
*   Subscription strategy ✔

Next comes the most complex part:

👉 Network Architecture (Hub-Spoke, vWAN, Segmentation, Connectivity)
