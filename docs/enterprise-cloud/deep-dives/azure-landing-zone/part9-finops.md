# 💰 Part 9 — FinOps & Cost Strategy

### _Where Cloud Transformation is Actually Judged_

No CFO cares about:

*   Hub-spoke
*   Terraform
*   Landing Zones

They care about:

> Are we spending more or less than before?”

🔥 First Principle

Cloud does not reduce cost automatically — it exposes inefficiency faster

* * *

## ❌ The Most Common Mistake

Teams assume:

*   “Cloud will be cheaper”

Without:

*   baseline
*   tracking
*   ownership

👉 Result:

> Cloud becomes more expensive than on-prem

* * *

## 🧠 What FinOps Actually Means

FinOps is not just cost tracking. It is:

*   cost visibility
*   cost accountability
*   cost optimization
*   business alignment

* * *

## 🔷 Core Components

### **1\. Cost Visibility (Day 0 Requirement)**

If you cannot see cost → you cannot control it

#### **How to achieve**

*   tagging (mandatory)
*   cost center mapping
*   subscription-level billing

#### **Real Example**

You should be able to answer:

> “How much does Core Banking cost per month?”

If not → design is already failing

* * *

### **2. Cost Ownership**

Every cost must have an owner


#### **Model**

| Entity | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| Platform Team | Shared services cost |
| App Team | Workload cost |
| Finance | Oversight |

👉 No owner = uncontrolled spend

* * *

### **3. Budget & Alerts**

#### **Define budgets**

*   per subscription
*   per application
*   per environment


#### **Example**

*   App1 Prod → ₹10L/month
*   Alert at:
    *   70%
    *   90%
    *   100%

👉 Prevent surprises

* * *

### **4. Right-Sizing (Biggest Quick Win)**

#### **Problem**

On-prem VMs are often:

*   over-provisioned
*   under-utilized

#### **In cloud**

*   reduce CPU/memory
*   shut down unused resources

👉 Immediate cost reduction

* * *

### **5. Reserved Instances / Savings Plans**

#### **Use when:**

*   workloads are stable
*   predictable usage

#### **Benefit**

*   up to 30–60% cost reduction

**Example**

Core Banking DB:

*   runs 24/7  
    👉 use reserved capacity

* * *

### **6. Auto-Scaling & Auto-Shutdown**

#### **Examples**

*   scale web apps during peak
*   shut down dev VMs at night

👉 Pay only for what you use

* * *

### **7. Storage Optimization**

#### **Common waste**

*   unused disks
*   snapshots
*   old backups

👉 Clean regularly

* * *

### **8. Cost Governance via Policy**

#### **Enforce:**

*   allowed SKUs
*   region restrictions
*   mandatory tags

👉 Prevent expensive mistakes

* * *

### **9. Cost Reporting**

#### Regular reports:

*   by application
*   by business unit
*   by environment

👉 Transparency builds accountability

* * *

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### ❌ No tagging

> 👉 no visibility

### ❌ Central team pays for everything

> 👉 no accountability

### ❌ Ignoring small resources

> 👉 hidden cost creep


### ❌ No cost reviews

> 👉 delayed reaction

* * *

## 🧠 Architect Thinking

You don’t ask:

“How much will cloud cost?”

You ask:

“How will cost be controlled, tracked, and optimized continuously?”

> If cost is not owned, it will grow uncontrollably

* * *

# 🔁 How Everything Connects

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Architecture | Defines design |
| Governance | Enforces rules |
| Automation | Ensures consistency |
| FinOps | Ensures sustainability |

Cloud success is not measured by migration. It is measured by:

*   control
*   predictability
*   efficiency
