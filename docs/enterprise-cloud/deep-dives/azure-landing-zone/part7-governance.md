# 🛡️ Part 7 — Security & Governance

### _Where Architecture Becomes Control_

Up to now, you have:

*   MG structure ✔
*   Subscription model ✔
*   Network design ✔
*   Identity model ✔

But none of this matters if:

> People can bypass it

🔥 First Principle

> In cloud, governance is not a document — it is enforced through policy

* * *

## ❌ The Most Common Mistake

Teams do:

*   define standards in PPT
*   write governance documents
*   share guidelines

But never enforce them.

👉 Result:

> Everyone builds differently anyway

* * *

## 🧠 What Governance Actually Means

Governance is:

*   what is allowed
*   what is denied
*   what is monitored
*   what is enforced automatically

* * *

## 🔷 Core Governance Components

### **1\. Azure Policy (Most Critical)**

This is your enforcement engine

**What it does**

*   Deny non-compliant deployments
*   Enforce configurations
*   Audit resources
*   Auto-remediate

**Real Examples**

*   ❌ Deny public IP creation
*   ❌ Deny deployment outside approved regions
*   ✔ Enforce tagging
*   ✔ Require encryption
*   ✔ Enable diagnostic logs

🔥 **Policy Types**


| Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Deny | Block non-compliant resources |
| Audit | Detect issues |
| DeployIfNotExists | Auto-fix |
| Modify | Enforce configuration |

**Real Example (PCI MG)**

At PCI MG:

*   Deny public IP
*   Require private endpoints
*   Enforce Defender
*   Require logging

👉 All workloads inherit automatically

* * *

### **2. Policy Initiatives (Policy Sets)**

Group policies into logical bundles

**For Example**:

**“PCI Baseline Initiative”**

*   No public IP
*   Encryption required
*   Logging mandatory
*   Approved regions

👉 Applied once → enforces everything

* * *

###  **3. Microsoft Defender for Cloud**

Security posture + threat protection

**What it does**

*   vulnerability assessment
*   security recommendations
*   threat detection
*   compliance scoring

**Real Example**

*   detects exposed ports
*   flags missing patches
*   alerts suspicious activity

* * *

### **4. Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM/SOAR)**

Central security monitoring

**What it does**

*   collects logs
*   correlates events
*   detects threats
*   automates response

**Real Example**

*   detects brute-force attempts
*   flags unusual login patterns
*   triggers incident workflows

* * *

### **5. Key Vault**

Secure secrets management

**Stores:**

*   passwords
*   certificates
*   API keys

**Real Example**

*   app retrieves secrets securely
*   no hardcoded credentials

* * *

### **6. Backup & DR Governance**

**Tools**

*   Recovery Services Vault
*   Azure Backup
*   Site Recovery

**Enforced via policy**

*   backup must be enabled
*   retention rules
*   geo-redundancy

* * *

### **7. Tagging Governance**

Critical for cost + ownership

**Example tags**

*   Application
*   Owner
*   Environment
*   Cost Center

**Enforced via:**

*   policy (mandatory tags)
*   automation

* * *

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### ❌ Too many policies too early

> 👉 blocks teams

### ❌ Audit-only mode forever

> 👉 no real enforcement

### ❌ No exception process

> 👉 teams bypass governance

### ❌ Policies without testing

> 👉 break deployments

* * *

## 🧠 Architect Thinking

You don’t ask:

“What policies should I create?

You ask:

“What behavior must never be allowed in this environment?”

> If it’s not enforced, it’s not governance

* * *

## 🔁 How Everything Connects


| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | Who can access |
| Network | How traffic flows |
| Policy | What is allowed |

> Governance is what turns architecture into a **platform**

Without it:

*   you have cloud  

With it:

*   you have controlled cloud

* * *

## What Comes Next

Now we move into:

⚙️ Deployment & Automation (IaC, CI/CD, Platform Engineering)

Because:

> If governance defines rules  
> Automation ensures they are followed consistently
