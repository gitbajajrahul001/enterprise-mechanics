# Observability – Case Study (ACME Corp)

This section extends the ACME Corp transformation journey, focusing on how observability evolved as systems became distributed across cloud environments.

During earlier phases, ACME Corp had:

- Monitoring tools in place (infrastructure + application)  
- Logging enabled across systems  
- Basic dashboards for key services  

At a glance, the environment appeared “observable”. However, as systems scaled and became more distributed, significant gaps started to emerge.

---

## 🔷 1. Initial Understanding

---

At the start of the Adopt phase, the perception was *We have dashboards, alerts, and logs — we are covered*

### **Observations**

- Multiple monitoring tools across teams  
- Dashboards created for different systems  
- Alerts configured for key metrics  

>
> Visibility existed — but understanding did not.
>

---

## 🔷 2. What We Discovered

---

As incidents began to occur in production, several issues surfaced:


### **Fragmented Tooling**

- Different tools for metrics, logs, and infrastructure  
- No unified view  

**Examples:**

- CPU spike visible in one tool  
- Application errors in another  
- No correlation between them  

### **Alert Fatigue**

- Large volume of alerts  
- Many were not actionable  

**Examples:**

- Repeated alerts for transient issues  
- Critical alerts missed due to noise  

### **Lack of Distributed Tracing**

- No visibility across service boundaries  


**Examples:**

- API request failing, but root cause unclear  
- Downstream service latency not visible  

### **Unstructured Logging**

- Logs inconsistent across applications  

**Examples:**

- Different log formats  
- Missing request identifiers  
- Difficult to trace request lifecycle  

### **No Context Around Changes**

- No visibility into deployments or configuration updates  

**Examples:**

- Performance degradation after deployment  
- No direct link between change and issue

## 🔷 3. Decisions Made

---

### **Decision 1: Consolidate Observability Strategy**

Instead of tool-centric approach:

- Defined centralized observability model  
- Standardized telemetry across systems  

**Examples:**

- Unified platform for metrics, logs, and traces  
- Common tagging and labeling strategy  

### **Decision 2: Introduce Structured Logging**

- Standardized log format across applications  
- Introduced correlation identifiers  

**Examples:**

- JSON-based logs  
- Request ID included in every log entry  

### **Decision 3: Implement Distributed Tracing**

- Enabled tracing across services  
- Propagated trace IDs end-to-end  

**Examples:**

- Tracking user request from frontend → backend → database  

### **Decision 4: Reduce Alert Noise**

- Refined alerting strategy  
- Focused on actionable alerts  

**Examples:**

- Removed low-value alerts  
- Introduced severity-based alerting  

### **Decision 5: Integrate Observability with CI/CD**

- Linked deployments with observability data  

**Examples:**

- Deployment events visible in dashboards  
- Ability to correlate issues with recent changes  

### **Decision 6: Define Ownership and Standards**

- Established observability ownership model  
- Defined logging and metrics standards  

**Examples:**

- Each team responsible for instrumenting services  
- Central team defining guidelines

## 🔷 4. What Changed During Execution

---


| Initial Assumption | Reality |
|------------------|--------|
| Monitoring tools provide sufficient visibility | Requires integration and correlation |
| Alerts help identify issues quickly | Too many alerts reduce effectiveness |
| Logs are enough for debugging | Need structured logs and traceability |
| Observability can be added later | Must be designed into applications |
| More data improves understanding | Context and correlation matter more |

>
> Observability evolved from tool-driven visibility to **system-level understanding**
>

---

## 🔷 5. Final Observability State

---

At the end of initial transformation phases, ACME Corp had:

- Centralized observability platform  
- Structured and standardized logging  
- Distributed tracing across services  
- Reduced and meaningful alerting  
- Integration with deployment pipelines  

### **Resulting Observability Model:**

## 🔍 Closing Thoughts

---

ACME Corp’s journey highlights that:

- Visibility without context is ineffective  
- Alerts must be meaningful, not frequent  
- Tracing is essential in distributed systems  
- Observability must be designed, not added
