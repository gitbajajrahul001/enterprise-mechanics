# 📚 Container Networking

Container networking is often introduced through Kubernetes abstractions, but underneath those abstractions lies a simpler and more fundamental reality — it is built on Linux networking primitives. At its core, container networking defines how isolated processes communicate, how identity is preserved, and how connectivity is established without relying on traditional infrastructure constructs.

In practice, container networking is not about learning new networking concepts, but about understanding how existing concepts — isolation, interfaces, routing, and address resolution — are applied in a distributed and highly dynamic environment.

This series explores container networking from first principles, gradually connecting low-level mechanics to higher-level platform behavior and architectural decisions.

# 🧭 Container Networking Journey 
   
Container networking is often introduced through platform abstractions, but it is fundamentally built on standard Linux networking principles. This journey starts by understanding what powers containers underneath, then builds up networking concepts from first principles, and finally connects them to platform behavior and architectural decisions.
